      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a beginner software developer looking to break into the workforce, one of the common questions I face is: what kind of project should I build to showcase my skills? One of the more popular replies is along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Build something you can use&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Build something that solves a problem for yourself.&amp;rdquo; This advice can be frustrating for me because I find it difficult to come up with ideas. I see myself as a soldier, a very good one, the kind you point at a problem and get good results delivered. So, coming up with a project that I would find useful was always going to be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
