Hello! My name is Talut Salako, and I am an aspiring backend Node.js developer with a deep passion for backend technology. When I'm not immersed in coding, I enjoy playing games, and I also have a keen interest in progressive fantasy novels. There's something incredibly captivating about the journey of advancing and becoming stronger that really resonates with me.
